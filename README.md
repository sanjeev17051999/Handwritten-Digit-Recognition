# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks

Overview:
This project aims to build a handwritten digit recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It allows users to draw a digit on a canvas interface, and the system predicts the digit based on the input drawing.

Dataset:
The project utilizes the MNIST dataset, a widely used benchmark dataset for handwritten digit recognition. The dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of hand-drawn digits from 0 to 9.

Preprocessing:
Prior to training the model, the dataset is preprocessed to reshape the images to a consistent size of 28x28 pixels and convert them to grayscale. The pixel values are normalized to a range of 0 to 1 for optimal training.

Model Architecture:
The CNN model architecture consists of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. These layers are designed to extract relevant features from the input images and make accurate predictions.

Training:
The model is trained using the training set of labeled images. The training process involves optimizing the model's parameters using the Adadelta optimizer and minimizing the categorical cross-entropy loss.

Model Evaluation:
After training, the model's performance is evaluated using the test set. The evaluation metrics include accuracy, which measures the percentage of correctly predicted digits.

User Interface:
The project incorporates a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, a Python library for creating GUI applications. The interface includes a canvas where users can draw their digits and buttons for recognition and clearing the canvas.

Prediction:
When the user clicks the "Recognize" button, the system captures the drawing from the canvas, processes it, and passes it through the trained model. The model predicts the digit and displays it on the interface.

Error Handling:
The project includes error handling to ensure smooth operation. If users draw outside the canvas or encounter any issues, appropriate error messages are displayed, providing a user-friendly experience.

Model Persistence:
The trained model is saved as a .h5 file, allowing it to be loaded and used for future predictions without the need for retraining. This feature enables the system to retain its learned knowledge and provides convenience.
